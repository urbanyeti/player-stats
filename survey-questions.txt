- Want to rate fictional / historical characters on 10 to 20 attributes
	- Examples: Ability to recognize patterns, Focus or ability to concentrate on a single task, Quickness to access longterm memory
	- Not too many questions for each character
	- Answering shouldn't take too long (your "gut feeling")

Questions:
- Best approach:
	- Ranking
	- Rating agreement
	- Compare between 2
	- Binary yes/no
- How many questions per character?
- How many characters per survey?
